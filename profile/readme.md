# Lurk
Lurk is an in-development programming language for Turing-complete recursive SNARKs.

## Disclaimer
**DISCLAIMER:** Lurk is an early research-stage language. Neither the cryptography nor the software has been audited, and there is currently no trusted setup for Groth16 circuits. Do not use Lurk in production environments or anywhere else that security is necessary.

## Features of Lurk
- Lurk program execution can be proved in zero knowledge.
- Lurk proofs support multiple backend SNARK proving systems.
- Lurk enables incremental computation and proofs in unbounded loops.
- Lurk provides conditional control flow.
- Lurk programs are data and vice versa.
- Lurk data is content-addressable for compatibility with IPLD/IPFS.
